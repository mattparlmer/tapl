# TAPL: Types and Programming Languages

This repository contains selected companion materials from Ben Pierce's 
TAPL ("Types and Programming Languages", MIT Press, 2002). The included
typecheckers are written in OCaml, configured and built with vanilla Unix
`make`, and generally fairly easy to parse. Lightly edited source code for
the typecheckers lives in `/typecheckers`, and `/tarballs` contains the
official resources distributed on the [TAPL website](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl/checkers).
